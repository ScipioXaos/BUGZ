# BUGZ! - A Python 'Learning' Adventure coded in Python!
# File Description:    World.py is used to create "worlds" which are collections
#                      of Map objects.  It is desired that in the future, user
#                      created content would be implemented through loading
#                      different worlds.

# Class Description:   World is the collection unit that holds all the Map 
#                      objects that will make up the game.  Worlds can be
#                      likened to Scenarios in other games.
